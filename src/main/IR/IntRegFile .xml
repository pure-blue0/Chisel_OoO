	<Function description="This is a two-dimensional integer register. The depth is Reg_Size and the width is 64 to store the data needed while the processor is running. 1. When reset=0, the data stored in the register is initialized to 0. 2. When the clock is on the rising edge, the module can handle the update requests of two Forwarding modules at the same time. When Forward1_valid=1 is received, data stored in the entry pointed by Forward1_PhyRd is updated according to the value of Forward1_data. When Forward2_valid=1 is received, the data stored in the entry pointed by Forward2_PhyRd is updated based on the value of Forward2_data. 3. When the clock is on the rising edge, the module can handle the update request of two WriteBack modules at the same time. When WB1_valid=1 is received, the data stored in the entry pointing to WB1_PhyRd is updated based on the value of WB1_RdResult. When WB1_valid=2 is received, the data stored in the entry pointed to by WB2_RdResult is updated based on the value of WB2_rdresult. 4. It can accept read PhyRs1 and PhyRs2 data request sent by three queues at the same time, and return the read data to the corresponding output port PhyRs1_data and PhyRs2_data. 5. Output the query data according to ROB_PhyRd1 and ROB_PhyRd2 to the output ports CommitInsn_PhyRd1_data and CommitInsn_PhyRd2_data."/>
