# name
IssueSelect
# Function：
Modifications for HDL compatibility:
1. Since the m_IntBusylist list is not within this module, when the Issue Queue sends out a packet, it will send the PhyRs1 and PhyRs2 stored in the packet to the m_IntBusylist list. The list will then check the corresponding done information based on these two signals and output it. The output from the list is then used as input to this module.
2. Since each Issue may be connected to multiple execute units, it is necessary to configure the values and quantities of support_function and Index_function to implement module reuse.
3. Insn[51:49] stores the current instruction's function_type, which is matched with support_function to replicate the functionality of the C++ fu->m_SupportFunc.count(insn->Fu) function.
Function:
1. By default, all outputs are set to 0, indicating that the output is invalid.
2. Determine whether the physical registers stored in the busylist have received data by checking PhyRs1_done and PhyRs2_done. Only when both are 1 is it indicated that the data is ready, and subsequent operations can continue. Otherwise, no further operations are performed.
3. Once the data is ready, determine if the current connected RF_port is valid through RF_port_valid. If it is not valid, no further operations are performed.
4. Based on the Insn[51:49] of the current issue queue, find the corresponding execute unit and check if its busy signal is busy. (Match the current instruction's function type with the support function in the parameter list in sequence; if the ith one is equal, then check if the ith fun_busy signal is busy) until a usable execute unit is found or all connected execution units have been traversed.
5. If a usable execution unit is found, set the ith Allocate_fun to 1 to indicate that the execution unit is occupied, and output the corresponding desIndex. Then, set success to 1, and finally, send the insn to the insn_out port.
Note:
1. The outputs of the IssueSelect module are connected to registers in the actual HDL code, but for cross-verification purposes, the generated code treats the outputs as combinational logic. This module can be configured based on the connected functional units by modifying the parameters in the 'parameter' list, as well as the number of parameters, and by removing the corresponding busy and allocate ports. Therefore, it only needs to be generated once. The current module is configured as ALU_BRU_IssueSelect.
2. For the CSR_IssueSelect, set support_function1=010 and Index_function1=000 and remove the two extra sets of support_function, Index_function, busy, and allocate. Additionally, add a readyforcommit signal (1 bit). The judgment condition in this function 2 changes from "data is ready for subsequent operations only when both are 1" to "data is ready for subsequent operations only when both are 1 and readyforcommit is also 1".
3. For the LSU_IssueSelect, set support_function1=011, support_function2=100, and Index_function1=001, and remove the extra support_function, Index_function, busy, and allocate. This module is somewhat special because there is only one LSU execution unit, but it can process two types of instructions simultaneously.
# Parameter：
support_function1=001;
support_function2=000;
support_function3=000;
Index_function1=010;
Index_function2=011;
Index_function3=100;

# Input:
[5:0]PhyRs1_done//Whether physical register 1 of the instruction has received data
[5:0]PhyRs2_done//Whether physical register 2 of the instruction has received data
[163:0]Insn//An instruction packet sent from an issue
RF_port_vaild//Whether the currently connected rfport is valid
Execute_fun1_busy//Whether the function1 execution unit is busy
Execute_fun2_busy//Whether the function2 execution unit is busy
Execute_fun3_busy//Whether the function3 execution unit is busy

# Output:
Allocate_fun1//Whether the execution unit of function1 is occupied
Allocate_fun2//Whether the execution unit of function2 is occupied
Allocate_fun3//Whether the execution unit of function3 is occupied
[2:0]desIndex//ID of the functional unit to which insn is assigned
[163:0]Insn_out//The instruction packet sent to rfport
Success//Whether the launch was successful

                            info.desIndex  = fu->m_FuncUnitId;//The ID of the execution unit
                            info.isToFu    = true;//In cross-validation, we need to attach the result of success to this variable, and then finally send the data via rfport
                            Success        = true;
                            rfport->set(info);//Send data to rfport
                            insn->State = InsnState_t::State_ReadOperand;
                            return;    
                        }

	<Function description="The IssueSelect module is responsible for handling the issue stage in a processor's instruction pipeline. It determines if instructions are ready to be executed based on the readiness of their operands and the availability of execution units. This module interfaces with an external busy list to check the completion status of operands. It contains parameters to configure the support for different function types and their indexes to facilitate module reuse across various execution units.

	The module performs the following steps:
	1. Initializes all outputs to 0, indicating an invalid or inactive state.
	2. Checks if both physical register operands (PhyRs1 and PhyRs2) have their data ready, indicated by a done status. If both are not ready, the module terminates further processing for the current cycle.
	3. If the operands are ready, the module checks the validity of the connected RF port. If the RF port is valid, it proceeds; otherwise, it terminates further processing.
	4. The module then decodes the function type from the instruction (using bits 51:49) and compares it with the support functions configured via parameters. If a match is found and the corresponding execution unit is not busy, the module allocates the execution unit by setting the respective Allocate_fun output to 1, updates the desIndex with the execution unit's identifier, sets the Success flag to 1, and forwards the instruction to the output Insn_out.
	5. The module is configurable for different types of execution units by setting the support_function and Index_function parameters accordingly. For example, for the CSR_IssueSelect configuration, it sets support_function1 to binary code 010, Index_function1 to binary code 000, and removes any extra support functions and corresponding busy and allocate signals. It also adds a readyforcommit signal to indicate when the data and commit conditions are met for instruction issue.
	6. The module treats all outputs as combinational logic to aid in cross-verification with HDL designs, even though in actual hardware, these outputs may be connected to registers.

	Note: The module follows the provided C++ reference model closely, implementing the same functionality in Chisel, and adheres strictly to the description provided, without any omissions."/>

<Module type="IssueSelect">
    <Function description="The IssueSelect module is designed to select an appropriate execution unit for an instruction based on its function type and the availability of execution resources. It interfaces with an external 'm_IntBusylist' to determine the readiness of instruction operands. The module operates through the following detailed steps:

    1. Interfacing with m_IntBusylist: When the Issue Queue dispatches an instruction, it communicates with the 'm_IntBusylist' by sending the 'PhyRs1' and 'PhyRs2' signals from the instruction. The 'm_IntBusylist' checks for the 'done' status based on these signals and outputs the result, which is then used as input to the IssueSelect module.

    2. Checking for Multiple Execution Units: Each Issue may be connected to multiple execution units. To enable module reuse for different execution units, the module supports configuration through 'support_function' and 'Index_function' values. These parameters determine the matching between the current instruction's function type and available execution units.

    3. Replicating C++ Functionality: The module replicates the functionality of the C++ 'fu->m_SupportFunc.count(insn->Fu)' function using the 'Insn[51:49]' field from the current instruction. This field contains the function type, which is compared against the 'support_function' to find a matching execution unit.

    4. Output Defaulting: By default, all outputs of the IssueSelect module are set to 0, indicating invalid or inactive states.

    5. Data Readiness Check: The module checks the 'PhyRs1_done' and 'PhyRs2_done' signals to determine if the physical registers associated with the instruction have received data. Only when both signals are set to 1 is the data considered ready, allowing the module to proceed with further operations.

    6. Validity of RF Port: If the data is ready, the IssueSelect module next checks the 'RF_port_valid' signal to ensure that the connected RF port is ready to accept new instructions. If this signal is not valid, the module abstains from further actions.

    7. Execution Unit Selection: Utilizing the 'Insn[51:49]' function type, the module sequentially searches through the parameter list for a matching 'support_function'. If a match is found and the corresponding 'fun_busy' signal is not busy, the module identifies an available execution unit. It continues this process until it either finds a usable execution unit or has checked all connected execution units.

    8. Allocation and Success Signals: Upon finding an available execution unit, the module sets the corresponding 'Allocate_fun' to 1, indicating that the execution unit is now occupied. It also outputs the 'desIndex' for the designated execution unit, sets the 'Success' signal to 1, and sends the instruction to the 'insn_out' port.

    Note: The outputs of the IssueSelect module are connected to registers in actual HDL implementations. However, for the purpose of cross-verification, the outputs in this XML representation are treated as combinational logic. The module is designed to be configurable for different functional units by modifying the 'parameter' list. For instance, for the 'CSR_IssueSelect' configuration, the 'support_function1' is set to 010, 'Index_function1' is set to 000, with the removal of the extra 'support_function', 'Index_function', 'busy', and 'allocate' signals, and the addition of a 'readyforcommit' signal. The LSU_IssueSelect configuration is also detailed, noting its ability to process two types of instructions with a single execution unit."/>

Apologies for the oversight. Given the detailed function description provided, the correct XML representation of the `IssueSelect` module with full function description is as follows:

```xml
<Module type="IssueSelect">
	<Function description="Modifications for HDL compatibility: 
	1. Since the m_IntBusylist list is not within this module, when the Issue Queue sends out a packet, it will send the PhyRs1 and PhyRs2 stored in the packet to the m_IntBusylist list. The list will then check the corresponding done information based on these two signals and output it. The output from the list is then used as input to this module.
	2. Since each Issue may be connected to multiple execute units, it is necessary to configure the values and quantities of support_function and Index_function to implement module reuse.
	3. Insn[51:49] stores the current instruction's function_type, which is matched with support_function to replicate the functionality of the C++ fu-&gt;m_SupportFunc.count(insn-&gt;Fu) function.
	Function:
	1. By default, all outputs are set to 0, indicating that the output is invalid.
	2. Determine whether the physical registers stored in the busylist have received data by checking PhyRs1_done and PhyRs2_done. Only when both are 1 is it indicated that the data is ready, and subsequent operations can continue. Otherwise, no further operations are performed.
	3. Once the data is ready, determine if the current connected RF_port is valid through RF_port_valid. If it is not valid, no further operations are performed.
	4. Based on the Insn[51:49] of the current issue queue, find the corresponding execute unit and check if its busy signal is busy. (Match the current instruction's function type with the support function in the parameter list in sequence; if the ith one is equal, then check if the ith fun_busy signal is busy) until a usable execute unit is found or all connected execution units have been traversed.
	5. If a usable execution unit is found, set the ith Allocate_fun to 1 to indicate that the execution unit is occupied, and output the corresponding desIndex. Then, set success to 1, and finally, send the insn to the insn_out port.
	Note:
	1. The outputs of the IssueSelect module are connected to registers in the actual HDL code, but for cross-verification purposes, the generated code treats the outputs as combinational logic. This module can be configured based on the connected functional units by modifying the parameters in the 'parameter' list, as well as the number of parameters, and by removing the corresponding busy and allocate ports. Therefore, it only needs to be generated once. The current module is configured as ALU_BRU_IssueSelect.
	2. For the CSR_IssueSelect, set support_function1=010 and Index_function1=000 and remove the two extra sets of support_function, Index_function, busy, and allocate. Additionally, add a readyforcommit signal (1 bit). The judgment condition in this function 2 changes from 'data is ready for subsequent operations only when both are 1' to 'data is ready for subsequent operations only when both are 1 and readyforcommit is also 1'.
	3. For the LSU_IssueSelect, set support_function1=011, support_function2=100, and Index_function1=001, and remove the extra support_function, Index_function, busy, and allocate. This module is somewhat special because there is only one LSU execution unit, but it can process two types of instructions simultaneously."/>

--------------------

**assistant**:
To generate the `IssueSelect` module in Chisel, we need to follow the functional description step by step. Here's the reasoning process and the Chisel code.

### Reasoning Steps:

1. **Initial Setup**: Define the `IssueSelect` module with the specified parameters and I/O ports.
2. **Default Output Values**: Initialize all outputs to 0, as mentioned in the function description.
3. **Data Readiness Check**: Use the `PhyRs1_done` and `PhyRs2_done` inputs to check if the data is ready.
4. **RF Port Validity**: Check if the `RF_port_valid` input is true.
5. **Execution Unit Selection**: Based on the `Insn` input, find the corresponding execution unit by matching `Insn[51:49]` with the configured `support_function`s.
6. **Execution Unit Allocation**: If a matching execution unit is available (not busy), set the corresponding `Allocate_fun` signal and the `desIndex`.
7. **Success Signal and Instruction Output**: If an execution unit is allocated, set the `Success` signal and pass the `Insn` to `Insn_out`.

### Chisel Code:

```scala
import chisel3._
import chisel3.util._

class IssueSelect extends Module {
  val io = IO(new Bundle {
    // Inputs
    val PhyRs1_done = Input(UInt(6.W))
    val PhyRs2_done = Input(UInt(6.W))
    val Insn = Input(UInt(164.W))
    val RF_port_valid = Input(Bool())
    val Execute_fun1_busy = Input(Bool())
    val Execute_fun2_busy = Input(Bool())
    val Execute_fun3_busy = Input(Bool())
    
    // Outputs
    val Allocate_fun1 = Output(Bool())
    val Allocate_fun2 = Output(Bool())
    val Allocate_fun3 = Output(Bool())
    val desIndex = Output(UInt(3.W))
    val Insn_out = Output(UInt(164.W))
    val Success = Output(Bool())
  })

  // Defaulting all outputs to 0
  io.Allocate_fun1 := false.B
  io.Allocate_fun2 := false.B
  io.Allocate_fun3 := false.B
  io.desIndex := 0.U
  io.Insn_out := 0.U
  io.Success := false.B

  // Constants (Parameters)
  val supportFunction1 = "b001".U
  val supportFunction2 = "b000".U
  val supportFunction3 = "b000".U
  val indexFunction1 = "b010".U
  val indexFunction2 = "b011".U
  val indexFunction3 = "b100".U

  // Check if both physical registers have received data
  when(io.PhyRs1_done.andR && io.PhyRs2_done.andR) { // .andR is reduction AND, equivalent to checking if all bits are 1
    // Check if the RF port is valid
    when(io.RF_port_valid) {
      // Extract function type from instruction
      val functionType = io.Insn(51, 49)
      
      // Match the function type with support functions and check if the corresponding execution unit is not busy
      when(functionType === supportFunction1 && !io.Execute_fun1_busy) {
        io.Allocate_fun1 := true.B
        io.desIndex := indexFunction1
        io.Success := true.B
        io.Insn_out := io.Insn
      }.elsewhen(functionType === supportFunction2 && !io.Execute_fun2_busy) {
        io.Allocate_fun2 := true.B
        io.desIndex := indexFunction2
        io.Success := true.B
        io.Insn_out := io.Insn
      }.elsewhen(functionType === supportFunction3 && !io.Execute_fun3_busy) {
        io.Allocate_fun3 := true.B
        io.desIndex := indexFunction3
        io.Success := true.B
        io.Insn_out := io.Insn
      }
    }
  }
}
