# Function(Do not omit or summarize the function description, describe it completely)：
This is a two-dimensional integer register. The depth is Reg_Size and the width is 64 to store the data needed while the processor is running
1. When reset=0, the data stored in the register is initialized to 0.
2. When the clock is on the rising edge, the module can handle the update requests of two Forwarding modules at the same time.When Forward1_valid=1 is received, data stored in the entry pointed by Forward1_PhyRd is updated according to the value of Forward1_data.When Forward2_valid=1 is received, the data stored in the entry pointed by Forward2_PhyRd is updated based on the value of Forward2_data.
3. When the clock is on the rising edge, the module can handle the update request of two WriteBack modules at the same time.When WB1_valid=1 is received, the data stored in the entry pointing to WB1_PhyRd is updated based on the value of WB1_RdResult.When WB1_valid=2 is received, the data stored in the entry pointed to by WB2_RdResult is updated based on the value of WB2_rdresult.
4. It can accept read PhyRs1 and PhyRs2 data request sent by three queues at the same time, and return the read data to the corresponding output port PhyRs1_data and PhyRs2_data
5. Output the query data according to ROB_PhyRd1 and ROB_PhyRd2 to the output ports CommitInsn_PhyRd1_data and CommitInsn_PhyRd2_data

--------------------

**assistant**:
To achieve the functionality described for the IntRegFile module in Chisel, let's break down the requirements and logic step by step before diving into the code generation.

### Reasoning Steps:

1. **Parameter Definition**: We need to define the `Reg_Size` parameter to determine the size of our register file.
   
2. **IO Definitions**: Based on the XML, we have a mix of input and output ports, specifically:
   - Inputs from the IssueSelect module for reading register IDs.
   - Inputs from Forwarding and WriteBack modules for updating register values.
   - Inputs for querying data from the ROB.
   - Outputs for providing data to RfReadPort and CommitInsn based on queries.

3. **Initialization**: On reset, all registers should be initialized to 0.

4. **Update Logic on Clock Edge**: We need to handle update requests from Forwarding and WriteBack modules on the rising edge of the clock. This involves checking valid signals and updating the corresponding register entry with the provided data.

5. **Read Logic**: The module should be able to accept read requests and output the requested register data on the corresponding output ports.

6. **Synchronization**: Ensure that updates and reads are properly synchronized with the clock to prevent race conditions.

### Chisel Code Generation:

Given the reasoning, here’s how the Chisel code for the IntRegFile module might look:

```scala
import chisel3._
import chisel3.util._

class IntRegFile extends Module {
  val Reg_Size = 40
  val io = IO(new Bundle {
    // Inputs
    val RF_Issue1_PhyRs1 = Input(UInt(6.W))
    val RF_Issue1_PhyRs2 = Input(UInt(6.W))
    val RF_Issue2_PhyRs1 = Input(UInt(6.W))
    val RF_Issue2_PhyRs2 = Input(UInt(6.W))
    val RF_Issue3_PhyRs1 = Input(UInt(6.W))
    val RF_Issue3_PhyRs2 = Input(UInt(6.W))
    
    val Forward1_valid = Input(Bool())
    val Forward1_PhyRd = Input(UInt(6.W))
    val Forward1_data = Input(UInt(64.W))
    val Forward2_valid = Input(Bool())
    val Forward2_PhyRd = Input(UInt(6.W))
    val Forward2_data = Input(UInt(64.W))
    
    val WB1_valid = Input(Bool())
    val WB1_PhyRd = Input(UInt(6.W))
    val WB1_RdResult = Input(UInt(64.W))
    val WB2_valid = Input(Bool())
    val WB2_PhyRd = Input(UInt(6.W))
    val WB2_RdResult = Input(UInt(64.W))
    
    val ROB_PhyRd1 = Input(UInt(6.W))
    val ROB_PhyRd2 = Input(UInt(6.W))

    // Outputs
    val RF_Issue1_PhyRs1_data = Output(UInt(64.W))
    val RF_Issue1_PhyRs2_data = Output(UInt(64.W))
    val RF_Issue2_PhyRs1_data = Output(UInt(64.W))
    val RF_Issue2_PhyRs2_data = Output(UInt(64.W))
    val RF_Issue3_PhyRs1_data = Output(UInt(64.W))
    val RF_Issue3_PhyRs2_data = Output(UInt(64.W))
    val CommitInsn_PhyRd1_data = Output(UInt(64.W))
    val CommitInsn_PhyRd2_data = Output(UInt(64.W))
  })

  val regFile = RegInit(VecInit(Seq.fill(Reg_Size)(0.U(64.W))))

  // Reset logic
  when(reset.asBool) {
    for (i <- 0 until Reg_Size) {
      regFile(i) := 0.U
    }
  }

  // Update logic on rising edge
  when(io.Forward1_valid) {
    regFile(io.Forward1_PhyRd) := io.Forward1_data
  }
  when(io.Forward2_valid) {
    regFile(io.Forward2_PhyRd) := io.Forward2_data
  }
  when(io.WB1_valid) {
    regFile(io.WB1_PhyRd) := io.WB1_RdResult
  }
  when(io.WB2_valid) {
    regFile(io.WB2_PhyRd) := io.WB2_RdResult
  }

  // Reading logic
  // Note: It's assumed that the read addresses are valid and within range
  io.RF_Issue1_PhyRs1_data := regFile(io.RF_Issue1_PhyRs1)
  io.RF_Issue1_PhyRs2_data := regFile(io.RF_Issue1_PhyRs2)
  io.RF_Issue2_PhyRs1_data := regFile(io.RF_Issue2_PhyRs1)
  io.RF_Issue2_PhyRs2_data := regFile(io.RF_Issue2_PhyRs2)
  io.RF_Issue3_PhyRs1_data := regFile(io.RF_Issue3_PhyRs1)
  io.RF_Issue3_PhyRs2_data := regFile(io.RF_Issue3_PhyRs2)
  io.CommitInsn_PhyRd1_data := regFile(io.ROB_PhyRd1)
  io.CommitInsn_PhyRd2_data := regFile(io.ROB_PhyRd2)
}

object IntRegFile extends App {
  (new chisel3.stage.ChiselStage).emitVerilog(new IntRegFile())
}
```

This code defines the `IntRegFile` module, including parameterization for register size, input and output interfaces, initialization logic, update logic for handling requests from forwarding and writeback units, and read logic for providing data to other parts of the system.
