TryIssueLoad
Compatible with HDL changes:
Since load queue is not in Tryissueload, it is not possible to change the state of entry in HDL as easily as C++, so FrontQueue_update, FrontQueue_state_new and ldqPtr_out are added. 
# Function：
1. This module is responsible for checking the next pending entry in the load queue, making a load memory request if it is ready and the conditions are met, and updating the queue entry state.
2. At the beginning of the function, the output parameter Success is set to false, indicating that the attempt to load the operation is failed by default
3. Check that the load queue is not empty: if the LoadQueue (store queue) is not empty, continue processing; Otherwise, the function terminates and Success remains false.
4. If the state of the input entry is load_WaitSend and the entry has not been killed, check it further.
5. If the address of the entry is ready, do the following:
(1) Mark Success as true, indicating that the storage operation can be initiated.
(2) Update the entry status to load_Inflight, indicating that the loading operation is in progress, and set FrontQueue_update to 1, lsqPtr_out=lsqPtr, FrontQueue_state_new=loadState_t::load_Inflight, which means that the request to modify data and the data to be modified are sent to load_queue
(3) Set the memory request (memReq) parameters, including Opcode (Opcode set to load), transaction ID (TransId set to ldqPtr), and request address (mem_Address, calculated from address alignment). And mem_Length (set according to the processor word length m_XLEN).
# Parameter：
dCacheAlignByte=8
X_LEN=16

# Input:
LoadQueue_empty//Describes whether the current load queue is empty
FrontQueue_addressReady//Describes whether the current entry address is ready
FrontQueue_killed//Describes whether the current entry is valid
[1:0]FrontQueue_state//Describes the current entry state
[31:0]FrontQueue_Address//Describes the current entry that needs to store the data address
 
[3:0]ldqPtr//The position of the current entry in the loadqueue
[3:0]Sub_OP//The specific action that the instruction needs to perform in the execution unit

# Output:
Success//Describe whether it can be fired
[1:0]mem_opcode//The type of request sent to mem
[3:0]mem_TransId//Record the position of the instruction that sent the mem request in storequeue
[31:0]mem_Address//Describes the address of the stored data currently to be sent to mem
[3:0]mem_Length//Describes the size of the stored data address currently to be sent to mem
//The following signals are used to update the status of the corresponding entry in the store queue
FrontQueue_update//Signals that need to be updated
[1:0]FrontQueue_state_new//Describes the updated entry state
[3:0]ldqPtr_out//The position of the current entry in loadqueue

# reference model
In the reference model, the c++ code for the corresponding module is as follows. Please refer to the code and implement the exact same function in chisel without omitting anything:
Possible enumeration types:
enum  MemOp_t{Fetch, Load, Store};
enum loadState_t{load_WaitSend,load_Inflight,load_Executed};

```cpp
void Lsq::TryIssueLoad(MemReq_t& memReq,bool& Success){
    Success = false;
    if(!this->m_LoadQueue.empty()){//需要加载的地址都放在了loadqueue里
        uint16_t ldqPtr = this->m_LoadQueue.getHeader();
        auto& ldqEntry = this->m_LoadQueue[ldqPtr];
        if(ldqEntry.state == loadState_t::load_WaitSend && !ldqEntry.killed){//在dispatch stage就已经改变了load state
            if(ldqEntry.addressReady )
            {
                
                Success = true;
                ldqEntry.state = loadState_t::load_Inflight;
                memReq.Opcode  = MemOp_t::Load;
                memReq.Address = ldqEntry.address & ~(this->m_dCacheAlignByte - 1);
                memReq.Id.TransId = ldqPtr;
                memReq.Length  = this->m_Processor->m_XLEN / 2;
            }
        }
    }
}

**assistant**:
To generate the TryIssueLoad module in Chisel based on the given requirements, we will follow these steps before diving into the code:

1. **Define Module and Parameters:** First, we define the module with the necessary parameters such as `dCacheAlignByte` and `X_LEN`. These parameters will be used to control certain logic and size of the data to be processed.

2. **Define Inputs and Outputs:** Next, we define all the inputs and outputs as described in the XML. This includes signals for checking the load queue, the current entry’s status, and outputs for indicating success, memory request details, and updated queue status.

3. **Implement Logic for Functionality:**
   - **Check Load Queue:** Begin with checking if the load queue is empty. If it is, the attempt to load is automatically failed.
   - **Entry State:** If the entry's state is `load_WaitSend` and it is not killed, check if the entry’s address is ready.
   - **Success and Update:** If the address is ready, set `Success` to true, update the entry state to `load_Inflight`, prepare the memory request with the appropriate opcode, transaction ID, and address (aligned as per `dCacheAlignByte`), and set the memory length.
   - **Update Signals:** Based on the entry processing, update the signals `FrontQueue_update`, `FrontQueue_state_new`, and `ldqPtr_out` accordingly.

Now, let's translate this into Chisel code:

```scala
import chisel3._
import chisel3.util._

class TryIssueLoad extends Module {
  val io = IO(new Bundle {
    val dCacheAlignByte = Input(UInt(32.W))
    val X_LEN = Input(UInt(32.W))
    
    val LoadQueue_empty = Input(Bool())
    val FrontQueue_addressReady = Input(Bool())
    val FrontQueue_killed = Input(Bool())
    val FrontQueue_state = Input(UInt(2.W))
    val FrontQueue_Address = Input(UInt(32.W))
    val ldqPtr = Input(UInt(4.W))
    val Sub_OP = Input(UInt(4.W))
    
    val Success = Output(Bool())
    val mem_opcode = Output(UInt(2.W))
    val mem_TransId = Output(UInt(4.W))
    val mem_Address = Output(UInt(32.W))
    val mem_Length = Output(UInt(4.W))
    val FrontQueue_update = Output(Bool())
    val FrontQueue_state_new = Output(UInt(2.W))
    val ldqPtr_out = Output(UInt(4.W))
  })

  // Initialize outputs
  io.Success := false.B
  io.mem_opcode := 0.U
  io.mem_TransId := 0.U
  io.mem_Address := 0.U
  io.mem_Length := 0.U
  io.FrontQueue_update := false.B
  io.FrontQueue_state_new := 0.U
  io.ldqPtr_out := 0.U

  // Load Issue Logic
  when(!io.LoadQueue_empty && io.FrontQueue_state === 0.U && !io.FrontQueue_killed) {
    when(io.FrontQueue_addressReady) {
      io.Success := true.B
      io.FrontQueue_update := true.B
      io.FrontQueue_state_new := 1.U // load_Inflight
      io.ldqPtr_out := io.ldqPtr
      
      io.mem_opcode := 1.U // Load
      io.mem_TransId := io.ldqPtr
      io.mem_Address := io.FrontQueue_Address & ~(io.dCacheAlignByte - 1.U)
      io.mem_Length := (io.X_LEN / 2.U)(3, 0) // Assuming X_LEN is always a multiple of 2
    }
  }
}

println((new chisel3.stage.ChiselStage).emitVerilog(new TryIssueLoad))
```

This Chisel code snippet defines the `TryIssueLoad` module with all the specified inputs and outputs, and it implements the functionality as described. The key logic is encapsulated within conditional checks that follow the requirements closely. Note that Chisel uses Scala syntax, and hardware description involves using Chisel's DSL for conditionals, bit manipulation, and signal assignments.
