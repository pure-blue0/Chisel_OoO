ReadyForCommit
Compatible with HDL changes:
1. Because the m_Rob queue is not built into the m_Rob module, it cannot be read at any time in the C++ way, nor can it be checked using a for loop like c++. Therefore, input the relevant data for Rob_Header and Rob_NextHeader at once, and then use the values of Rob_Usage and m_DeallocWidth to decide what data needs to be judged.
# Function：
1. The ReadyForCommit function is used to check whether a given RobTag meets the commit criteria. This involves determining the status of the ROB, the order of the robtags, and the stability and type of the entries in the ROB. This is an important mechanism to ensure data consistency and correctness in out-of-order execution environments. This module has a submodule called isolder, which takes three arguments: tag1, tag2, and header.The return value isolder
2. Check the status of ROB and the order of RobTag:
(1) If ROB is idle (rob_state_t::Rob_Idle) or RobTag is older than the rollback tag (this->m_RollBackTag) (that is, it is earlier in the ROB), proceed to the next step. This requires calling the isolder submodule with the inputs RobTag, Rob_Header, Rob_Header
(2) Otherwise, if ROB is in the waiting state (rob_state_t::Rob_WaitForResume) and the rollback tag is RobTag, the current instruction is ready to commit and outputs 1 directly.
3. If case 1 of 2 is true, the following actions are required:
(1) First determine how many rob entries need to be evaluated according to the minimum values of Rob_Usage and m_DeallocWidth entered. If the minimum value is 0, then no judgment is made and false is output.If the minimum value is 1, the judgment is based on the entry of Rob_Header only; if the minimum value is 2, the judgment is based on the entry of both Rob_Header and Rob_NextHeader.
(2) If RobTag is the current Rob_Header, output 1 directly. Otherwise, proceed to check whether Header_isStable is stable and whether Header_Function_type is a type of instruction for LDU,STU, or BRU. If the entry is unstable and belongs to an operation of type load (LDU), store (STU) or branch (BRU), the current RobTag cannot commit and directly outputs 0.Once the judgment is made, it will no longer be judged based on the relevant data of NextHeader
(3) If neither of the two cases in (2) matches, repeat the operation in (2) on the relevant data of the NextHeader.
4. End of traversal without meeting submission conditions: If no valid data is returned after traversing the specified number of entries, then RobTag is not ready for submission, and the final output is 0.
# Parameter：
m_DeallocWidth=2

# Input:
[3:0]Rob_Tag//Pointer of the instruction that needs to be submitted in ROB
[3:0]Rob_Header//Rob's head pointer
[3:0]Rob_NextHeader//Rob's next header pointer
[2:0]m_RobState//rob status
[3:0]m_RollBackTag//Rolling back labels
[3:0]Rob_Usage//Number of entries of Rob that have been used
 
Header_isStable//The isStable signal stored in Header entry
[2:0]Header_Function_type//The execution unit to call for the store instruction in Header entry
NextHeader_isStable//The isStable signal stored in NextHeader entry
[2:0]NextHeader_Function_type//The execution unit to call for the store instruction in NextHeader entry

# Output:
Ready//Indicates whether the entered Robtag is ready for submission

# reference model
In the reference model, the c++ code for the corresponding module is as follows. Please refer to the code and implement the exact same function in chisel without omitting anything:
```cpp
enum rob_state_t{Rob_Idle, Rob_Undo, Rob_Redo, Rob_WaitForResume, Rob_FlushBackend};
enum funcType_t { ALU , BRU, CSR, LDU, STU};

bool Rcu::ReadyForCommit(uint64_t RobTag){
    uint64_t RobPtr = this->m_Rob.getHeader();
    if(this->m_RobState == rob_state_t::Rob_Idle ||  this->m_Rob.isOlder(RobTag,this->m_RollBackTag)){
        for(size_t i = 0; i < this->m_DeallocWidth && i < this->m_Rob.getUsage(); i++){
            if(RobPtr == RobTag){
                return true;
            }else{
                auto RobEntry = this->m_Rob[RobPtr];
                if( !RobEntry.isStable && (RobEntry.Fu == funcType_t::LDU || 
                    RobEntry.Fu == funcType_t::STU || RobEntry.Fu == funcType_t::BRU))
                {
                    return false;
                }
                RobPtr = this->m_Rob.getNextPtr(RobPtr);
            }
        }
    }else{
        if(this->m_RobState == rob_state_t::Rob_WaitForResume && this->m_RollBackTag == RobTag){//A rollback operation was performed in the rob of the previous cycle
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

--------------------

**assistant**:
To approach the design of the `ReadyForCommit` module in Chisel based on the provided specification, we’ll follow these steps:

### Step 1: Analyze the Inputs and Outputs
First, we need to understand the inputs and outputs and their roles in the module.
- Inputs: Rob_Tag, Rob_Header, Rob_NextHeader, m_RobState, m_RollBackTag, Rob_Usage, Header_isStable, Header_Function_type, NextHeader_isStable, NextHeader_Function_type.
- Output: Ready (Boolean indicating if the RobTag is ready for submission).

### Step 2: Understand the Functionality
The module's core functionality is to determine whether a given instruction identified by RobTag is ready for commit based on several conditions related to the state of the Reorder Buffer (ROB) and the stability and type of its entries.

### Step 3: Determine the Logic
- Check if the ROB is idle or if the RobTag is older than the m_RollBackTag.
- If true, iterate through the entries based on `m_DeallocWidth` and `Rob_Usage` to determine if RobTag matches RobPtr or if the entry is stable and not of type LDU, STU, or BRU.
- If ROB is in a waiting state and RobTag matches m_RollBackTag, it's ready for commit.
- If none of the conditions are met, the RobTag is not ready for commit.

### Step 4: Implement in Chisel
```scala
import chisel3._
import chisel3.util._

class ReadyForCommit extends Module {
  val io = IO(new Bundle {
    val robTag = Input(UInt(4.W))
    val robHeader = Input(UInt(4.W))
    val robNextHeader = Input(UInt(4.W))
    val mRobState = Input(UInt(3.W))
    val mRollBackTag = Input(UInt(4.W))
    val robUsage = Input(UInt(4.W))
    val headerIsStable = Input(Bool())
    val headerFunctionType = Input(UInt(3.W))
    val nextHeaderIsStable = Input(Bool())
    val nextHeaderFunctionType = Input(UInt(3.W))
    val ready = Output(Bool())
  })

  // Rob states and function types as Enums
  val robIdle :: robUndo :: robRedo :: robWaitForResume :: robFlushBackend :: Nil = Enum(5)
  val alu :: bru :: csr :: ldu :: stu :: Nil = Enum(5)

  // Initial Ready signal as false
  io.ready := false.B

  // Check conditions based on the provided functionality
  when(io.mRobState === robIdle || (io.robTag < io.mRollBackTag && io.robUsage > 0.U)) {
    when(io.robTag === io.robHeader || io.robTag === io.robNextHeader) {
      io.ready := true.B
    } .elsewhen(!(io.headerIsStable && (io.headerFunctionType === ldu || io.headerFunctionType === stu || io.headerFunctionType === bru)) || !(io.nextHeaderIsStable && (io.nextHeaderFunctionType === ldu || io.nextHeaderFunctionType === stu || io.nextHeaderFunctionType === bru))) {
      io.ready := false.B
    }
  } .elsewhen(io.mRobState === robWaitForResume && io.robTag === io.mRollBackTag) {
    io.ready := true.B
  }

}

// Generate the Verilog code
object ReadyForCommit extends App {
  (new chisel3.stage.ChiselStage).emitVerilog(new ReadyForCommit())
}
```

### Step 5: Verification
After implementing the module, it's crucial to verify its functionality through simulation and testing, ensuring it meets the specified requirements without omitting any signal definition or logic.

This Chisel code snippet follows the functionality described in the reference model, taking into account the detailed specifications provided for the `ReadyForCommit` module. Adjustments may be necessary depending on the broader context of the system and specific implementation details of the ROB and function type handling.
