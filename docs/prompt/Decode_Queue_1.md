Decode_Queue
A controllable double-in double-out FIFO, containing 16 entries, each entry structure is as follows:
[31:0]pc// instruction address
[4:0] IsaRs1 //address of rs1 register
Operand1Ready //whether the operand of rs1 is ready
[4:0] IsaRs2//address of rs2 register
Operand2Ready//whether the operand of rs2 is ready
[4:0] IsaRd//address of rd register
ControlFlowInsn//whether it is a control flow instruction, used to indicate whether the instruction will change the execution flow of the program
[2:0] Function_type//the execution unit that the instruction needs to be called, including ALU, BRU, CSR, LDU, STU
[3:0] Sub_OP//the specific operation that the instruction needs to perform in the execution unit
[31:0] imm//storage immediately number
excp_valid//storage the exception of the current instruction
[5:0] excp_cause//storage the type of the current exception instruction
[31:0] excpt_tval//storage the address of the current exception instruction
# Function：
1. According to the reset signal for reset
2. Able to achieve all data in the entry read and write
3. With two input data port decoded_insn1 and decoded_insn2 and two write enable signals wr_en1 and wr_en2, can be in a cycle according 
   to the value of the write enable signal to write a data or write two data in order.
4. When the number of entries stored in the FIFO is greater than 2, two entries can be read from the FIFO at once. When entry=1 with data stored in the FIFO, the data is read out via entry_out1. It then outputs the number of entry_num entries actually readout-note that it is not popped at this point
5. Be able to according to the value of the input pop_count will be specified number of entry data from the queue pop
6. Able to record the current header and tail pointer, and update
7. Output the current queue is full or empty

**assistant**:
To design the `Decode_Queue` module in Chisel, we must first understand each requirement and functionality that needs to be implemented. Here is the step-by-step reasoning and the corresponding Chisel code.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Module Interface:** Define a module `Decode_Queue` with the required inputs and outputs as specified.
2. **FIFO Implementation:** Since we need to store up to 16 entries, a register array or a queue can be used to implement the FIFO.
3. **Reset Logic:** Implement logic to initialize or reset the FIFO state upon receiving a reset signal.
4. **Write Logic:** Based on the `wr_en1` and `wr_en2` signals, write one or two data entries into the FIFO per cycle.
5. **Read Logic:** Implement the logic to read and output one or two entries based on the FIFO's current number of entries and `pop_count` input.
6. **Pointer Management:** Maintain and update head and tail pointers to manage the FIFO.
7. **Full and Empty Indicators:** Implement logic to set `fifo_full` and `fifo_empty` signals based on the FIFO status.

### Chisel Code

```scala
import chisel3._
import chisel3.util._

class Decode_Queue extends Module {
  val io = IO(new Bundle {
    val clk = Input(Clock())
    val reset = Input(Bool())
    val decoded_insn1 = Input(UInt(128.W))
    val decoded_insn2 = Input(UInt(128.W))
    val wr_en1 = Input(Bool())
    val wr_en2 = Input(Bool())
    val pop_count = Input(UInt(2.W))
    val entry_out1 = Output(UInt(128.W))
    val entry_out2 = Output(UInt(128.W))
    val fifo_full = Output(Bool())
    val fifo_empty = Output(Bool())
    val head_ptr = Output(UInt(4.W))
    val tail_ptr = Output(UInt(4.W))
  })

  val queue = SyncReadMem(16, UInt(128.W))
  val head = RegInit(0.U(4.W))
  val tail = RegInit(0.U(4.W))
  val count = RegInit(0.U(5.W)) // Extra bit to distinguish full from empty
  
  when(io.reset) {
    head := 0.U
    tail := 0.U
    count := 0.U
  }

  // Write logic
  when(io.wr_en1 && !io.fifo_full) {
    queue(tail) := io.decoded_insn1
    tail := tail + 1.U
    count := count + 1.U
  }
  when(io.wr_en2 && !io.fifo_full && (!io.wr_en1 || count < 15.U)) {
    queue(tail) := io.decoded_insn2
    tail := tail + 1.U
    count := count + 1.U
  }

  // Read logic
  io.entry_out1 := 0.U
  io.entry_out2 := 0.U
  when(io.pop_count === 1.U && count > 0.U) {
    io.entry_out1 := queue(head)
    head := head + 1.U
    count := count - 1.U
  }.elsewhen(io.pop_count > 1.U && count > 1.U) {
    io.entry_out1 := queue(head)
    io.entry_out2 := queue(head + 1.U)
    head := head + 2.U
    count := count - 2.U
  }

  // FIFO status
  io.fifo_full := count === 16.U
  io.fifo_empty := count === 0.U
  io.head_ptr := head
  io.tail_ptr := tail
}

// Generate the Verilog code
object DecodeQueueVerilog extends App {
  (new chisel3.stage.ChiselStage).emitVerilog(new Decode_Queue())
}
```

### Explanation

- The FIFO's size is hardcoded as 16, matching the description. We use a `SyncReadMem` for the FIFO storage for simplicity.
- `head` and `tail` pointers, along with a `count` variable, are used to manage the FIFO's state.
- The write logic checks if there is space available (`!io.fifo_full`) before writing. If both `wr_en1` and `wr_en2` are active and there is space, two entries are written.
- The read logic outputs data based on `pop_count`. If `pop_count` is 1 and the FIFO isn't empty, one entry is output; if `pop_count` is greater than 1 and there are at least two entries, two entries are output.
- The FIFO full and empty status signals are derived from the `count`.
- Note: This implementation assumes the FIFO is synchronous and utilizes Chisel's built-in `SyncReadMem` for simplicity. Additional considerations might be needed for asynchronous read/write operations or other specific FIFO behaviors not covered in this basic implementation.
