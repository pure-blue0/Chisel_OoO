# name
RollBack
# Function(Do not omit or summarize the function description, describe it completely)：
Adjustments for HDL compatibility:
1. Since the ROB is not built into the module, it is not possible to read one piece of data, make a determination, and then read the next one as the module would allow. Given that the maximum value for m_AllocWidth is 2, the two pieces of data at the tail of the ROB that need to be used are directly input into this module, to be used according to the actual situation.
2. The for loop has been removed, and an equivalent judgment method is used to assess the two pieces of input data separately.
3. Output flags are used to inform the ROB and ReleaseResource module whether data needs to be updated.
4. The functionality of this->m_Rob.RollBack() in C++ is implemented in the ROB, which will determine how many instructions the RollBack module has processed based on the returned Rob_Tail_update and Rob_beforeTail_update, and then proceed with the rollback.

Function:
1. This module is used to roll back the ROB and release the corresponding resources. Inside the module is a submodule isolder, which requires three input parameters: tag1, tag2, and header, returning a value older.
2. By default, m_RobState_new is set to m_RobState, and all other outputs are set to 0, indicating no rollback operation.
3. The isolder submodule is called to determine which is older between m_RollBackTag and Rob_tail, requiring input data m_RollBackTag, Rob_tail, and Rob_header, and returning a 1-bit older value. If older=1 or m_RollBackTag=Rob_tail, the following actions are taken:
(1) Check if Rob_Tail_valid is 1; if so, continue to check if m_RollBackTag equals Rob_tail.
(2) If m_RollBackTag=Rob_tail, set m_RobState_new to Rob_WaitForResume and determine if Rob_Tail_isExcp is 1.
(3) If Rob_Tail_isExcp=1, assign Rob_Tail_phyRd, Rob_Tail_LphyRd, Rob_Tail_isaRd, Rob_Tail_Function, Rob_Tail_LSQTag to the corresponding outputs Rob_Tail_phyRd_out, Rob_Tail_LphyRd_out, Rob_Tail_isaRd_out, Rob_Tail_Function_out, Rob_Tail_LSQTag_out, and set data_valid1 to 1. Subsequently, set all other unassigned outputs to 0, with no further actions taken.
(4) If Rob_Tail_isExcp is not 1, set Rob_Tail_update to 1, indicating that the data at the tail of the rob is invalidated. Also, assign Rob_Tail_phyRd, Rob_Tail_LphyRd, Rob_Tail_isaRd, Rob_Tail_Function, Rob_Tail_LSQTag to the corresponding outputs, and set data_valid1 to 1.
4. The isolder submodule is called to determine which is older between m_RollBackTag and Rob_before_tail, requiring input data m_RollBackTag, Rob_before_tail, and Rob_header, and returning a 1-bit older value. If older=1 or m_RollBackTag=Rob_before_tail, the following actions are taken:
(1) Check if Rob_beforeTail_valid is 1; if so, continue to check if m_RollBackTag equals Rob_before_tail.
(2) If m_RollBackTag=Rob_before_tail, set m_RobState_new to Rob_WaitForResume and determine if Rob_beforeTail_isExcp is 1.
(3) If Rob_beforeTail_isExcp=1, assign Rob_beforeTail_phyRd, Rob_beforeTail_LphyRd, Rob_beforeTail_isaRd, Rob_beforeTail_Function, Rob_beforeTail_LSQTag to the corresponding outputs Rob_beforeTail_phyRd_out, Rob_beforeTail_LphyRd_out, Rob_beforeTail_isaRd_out, Rob_beforeTail_Function_out, Rob_beforeTail_LSQTag_out, and set data_valid2 to 1. Subsequently, set all other unassigned outputs to 0, with no further actions taken.
(4) If Rob_beforeTail_isExcp is not 1, set Rob_beforeTail_update to 1, indicating that the data at the penultimate position of the rob is invalidated. Also, assign Rob_beforeTail_phyRd, Rob_beforeTail_LphyRd, Rob_beforeTail_isaRd, Rob_beforeTail_Function, Rob_beforeTail_LSQTag to the corresponding outputs, and set data_valid2 to 1.

Function:
1. This module is used to roll back the ROB and release the corresponding resources. Inside the module is a submodule isolder, which requires three input parameters: tag1, tag2, and header, returning a value older.
2. By default, m_RobState_new is set to m_RobState, and all other outputs are set to 0, indicating no rollback operation.
3. The isolder submodule is called to determine which is older between m_RollBackTag and Rob_tail, requiring input data m_RollBackTag, Rob_tail, and Rob_header, and returning a 1-bit older value. If older=1 or m_RollBackTag=Rob_tail, the following actions are taken:
(1) Check if Rob_Tail_valid is 1; if so, continue to check if m_RollBackTag equals Rob_tail.
(2) If m_RollBackTag=Rob_tail, set m_RobState_new to Rob_WaitForResume and determine if Rob_Tail_isExcp is 1.
(3) If Rob_Tail_isExcp=1, assign Rob_Tail_phyRd, Rob_Tail_LphyRd, Rob_Tail_isaRd, Rob_Tail_Function, Rob_Tail_LSQTag to the corresponding outputs Rob_Tail_phyRd_out, Rob_Tail_LphyRd_out, Rob_Tail_isaRd_out, Rob_Tail_Function_out, Rob_Tail_LSQTag_out, and set data_valid1 to 1. Subsequently, set all other unassigned outputs to 0, with no further actions taken.
(4) If Rob_Tail_isExcp is not 1, set Rob_Tail_update to 1, indicating that the data at the tail of the rob is invalidated. Also, assign Rob_Tail_phyRd, Rob_Tail_LphyRd, Rob_Tail_isaRd, Rob_Tail_Function, Rob_Tail_LSQTag to the corresponding outputs, and set data_valid1 to 1.
4. The isolder submodule is called to determine which is older between m_RollBackTag and Rob_before_tail, requiring input data m_RollBackTag, Rob_before_tail, and Rob_header, and returning a 1-bit older value. If older=1 or m_RollBackTag=Rob_before_tail, the following actions are taken:
(1) Check if Rob_beforeTail_valid is 1; if so, continue to check if m_RollBackTag equals Rob_before_tail.
(2) If m_RollBackTag=Rob_before_tail, set m_RobState_new to Rob_WaitForResume and determine if Rob_beforeTail_isExcp is 1.
(3) If Rob_beforeTail_isExcp=1, assign Rob_beforeTail_phyRd, Rob_beforeTail_LphyRd, Rob_beforeTail_isaRd, Rob_beforeTail_Function, Rob_beforeTail_LSQTag to the corresponding outputs Rob_beforeTail_phyRd_out, Rob_beforeTail_LphyRd_out, Rob_beforeTail_isaRd_out, Rob_beforeTail_Function_out, Rob_beforeTail_LSQTag_out, and set data_valid2 to 1.

--------------------

**assistant**:
To generate the `RollBack` module in Chisel, we'll follow the steps provided in the functional description and incorporate all the I/O ports.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. We need to define a Chisel module `RollBack` with all the input and output ports as specified. Each port needs to match the given type, which we'll interpret as UInt widths for the purpose of Chisel.

2. According to the functionality, we'll have to implement a comparison logic to determine which of the tags (`m_RollBackTag`, `Rob_tail`, `Rob_before_tail`) is the oldest based on the header (`Rob_header`). This will likely be a helper method.

3. The primary logic will consist of two main parts: one for handling the `Rob_tail` and another for `Rob_before_tail`. Each part will check the validity and exception status of the respective entry and set the output signals accordingly.

4. We need to set the `m_RobState_new` based on the condition whether the rollback tag matches the tail or before-tail tags and if an exception is flagged.

5. Outputs such as `Rob_Tail_update` and `Rob_beforeTail_update` are to be set when a rollback operation is necessary.

6. The C++ reference model provides clues on how to update states and manage the rollback process.

  // Implement the isOlder function according to the system's ROB logic
  // This will take into account the circular nature of the ROB
}
```

This Chisel code provides a structure that starts to meet the requirements of the `RollBack` module. The `isOlder` function needs to be properly implemented to reflect the circular buffer nature of the ROB, which isn't detailed here and would depend on the overall system design. The `when` blocks handle the conditional logic described in the functional description, setting the outputs and update flags as required.

--------------------

--------------------

**assistant**:
To complete the `isOlder` helper function in Chisel, we need to consider the circular nature of the ROB (Reorder Buffer). The ROB is typically implemented as a circular queue, so determining which tag is older requires special handling when the tags wrap around the maximum value.

The logic for the `isOlder` function would typically compare the distances of each tag from the head of the ROB, considering the wraparound. A tag is older if it is closer to the head than the other tag when moving through the buffer in a circular manner.

Here is how you might implement the `isOlder` function in Chisel:

```scala
// Helper function to determine which tag is older
def isOlder(tag1: UInt, tag2: UInt, header: UInt): Bool = {
  val sizeOfROB = (1 << header.getWidth) // Size of ROB inferred from header width, assuming power of 2
  val mask = sizeOfROB - 1.U // Mask for wrapping around

  // Calculate the distance from the head for both tags, wrapping around if necessary
  val distance1 = (tag1 - header) & mask
  val distance2 = (tag2 - header) & mask

  // Tag1 is older if its distance from the head is less than tag2's distance
  distance1 < distance2
}
```

Now, you would integrate this function into the main Chisel module for the RollBack logic. Here's how you might call this function within the `when` conditions:

```scala
// Main rollback logic for Rob_tail
when(isOlder(io.m_RollBackTag, io.Rob_tail, io.Rob_header) || io.m_RollBackTag === io.Rob_tail) {
  // ... (rest of the logic)
}

// Main rollback logic for Rob_before_tail
when(isOlder(io.m_RollBackTag, io.Rob_before_tail, io.Rob_header) || io.m_RollBackTag === io.Rob_before_tail) {
  // ... (rest of the logic)
}
```

With this function implemented, you can compare tags to determine which one is older in the ROB. Please note that this logic assumes the size of the ROB is a power of two, which is common in hardware design for efficient modulo operation using bitwise AND. If the size of the ROB is not a power of two, the logic would need to be adjusted accordingly.

**user**:
complete Main rollback logic for Rob_tail;complete Main rollback logic for Rob_before_tail.

--------------------

**assistant**:
To complete the main rollback logic for both `Rob_tail` and `Rob_before_tail` within the Chisel `RollBack` module, we need to follow the described functionality closely. The logic will control the rollback operations based on the comparison of rollback tags, the validity of the entries, and whether an exception (Excp) has occurred.

First, let's define the `isOlder` function:

```scala
def isOlder(tag1: UInt, tag2: UInt, header: UInt): Bool = {
  val robSize = 1.U << header.getWidth.W
  val pos1 = (tag1 - header) & (robSize - 1.U)
  val pos2 = (tag2 - header) & (robSize - 1.U)
  pos1 < pos2
}
```

Now, let's complete the main rollback logic for `Rob_tail`:

```scala
when(isOlder(io.m_RollBackTag, io.Rob_tail, io.Rob_header) || io.m_RollBackTag === io.Rob_tail) {
  when(io.Rob_Tail_valid) {
    io.m_RobState_new := "b100".U // Assuming Rob_WaitForResume is binary 100
    when(io.m_RollBackTag === io.Rob_tail) {
      when(io.Rob_Tail_isExcp) {
        io.Data_valid1 := true.B
        io.Rob_Tail_phyRd_out := io.Rob_Tail_phyRd
        io.Rob_Tail_LphyRd_out := io.Rob_Tail_LphyRd
        io.Rob_Tail_isaRd_out := io.Rob_Tail_isaRd
        io.Rob_Tail_Function_out := io.Rob_Tail_Function
        io.Rob_Tail_LSQTag_out := io.Rob_Tail_LSQTag
      }.otherwise {
        io.Rob_Tail_update := true.B
      }
    }
  }
}
```

And for `Rob_before_tail`:

```scala
when(isOlder(io.m_RollBackTag, io.Rob_before_tail, io.Rob_header) || io.m_RollBackTag === io.Rob_before_tail) {
  when(io.Rob_beforeTail_valid) {
    io.m_RobState_new := "b100".U // Assuming Rob_WaitForResume is binary 100
    when(io.m_RollBackTag === io.Rob_before_tail) {
      when(io.Rob_beforeTail_isExcp) {
        io.Data_valid2 := true.B
        io.Rob_beforeTail_phyRd_out := io.Rob_beforeTail_phyRd
        io.Rob_beforeTail_LphyRd_out := io.Rob_beforeTail_LphyRd
        io.Rob_beforeTail_isaRd_out := io.Rob_beforeTail_isaRd
        io.Rob_beforeTail_Function_out := io.Rob_beforeTail_Function
        io.Rob_beforeTail_LSQTag_out := io.Rob_beforeTail_LSQTag
      }.otherwise {
        io.Rob_beforeTail_update := true.B
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In the above logic:

- `m_RobState_new` is set to `Rob_WaitForResume` when a rollback condition is met.
- `Data_valid1` and `Data_valid2` are flags to indicate whether the tail and before-tail data are valid for rollback.
- The output signals, such as `Rob_Tail_phyRd_out`, `Rob_Tail_LphyRd_out`, and others, are assigned from their corresponding input signals if an exception is detected.
- `Rob_Tail_update` and `Rob_beforeTail_update` are set to true to indicate that the data at the respective ROB positions are to be invalidated if no exception is detected.

This logic assumes that the rollback state `Rob_WaitForResume` is represented by the binary value `"b100"`. This binary representation should be replaced with the actual value used in your system's state encoding. The `isOlder` function is called to determine if a rollback should occur based on the age of the tags relative to the `Rob_header`.

This completes the main rollback logic for both `Rob_tail` and `Rob_before_tail` within the Chisel `RollBack` module.
