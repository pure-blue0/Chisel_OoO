# name
LoadQueue
# Function(Do not omit or summarize the function description, describe it completely)：
This module serves as a storage for load instruction requests sent to memory, operating as a circular queue with a depth of load_queue_size and a width of 197 bits. As a circular queue, it ensures that the header, tail, or nextTail pointers wrap around to the other end of the queue when they reach the boundary, thus enabling the cyclical behavior. Furthermore, the queue is capable of updating the data within each entry on every rising edge of the clock cycle based on input signals and can output relevant data at any time through combinational logic queries.
The data format within an entry is as follows:
Bits	Description
196:165	excp_tval
164:159	excp_cause
158	excp_valid
157:126	imm
125:122	Sub_OP
121:119	Function_type
118	ControlFlowInsn
117:113	IsaRd
112	Operand2Ready
111:107	IsaRs2
106	Operand1Ready
105:101	IsaRs1
100:69	pc
68:65	LSQTag
64:61	RobTag
60:55	PhyRs1
54:49	PhyRs2
48:43	PhyRd
42:37	LPhyRd
36:35	state
34	commited
33	Killed
32	addressReady
31:0	address
The operations are as follows:
1. When reset=0, all data stored within the entries of the queue are initialized to 0. The header, tail, usage count, and Empty flags are also set to 0, while nextTail is set to 1, indicating the next tail pointer position.
2. On the rising edge of the clock, data is written into the queue in order if LA_EN1 and LA_EN2 are asserted. If LA_EN1=1, Entry_data1 is written into the entry pointed by the tail, and both tail and nextTail are incremented by 1. If LA_EN2=1, Entry_data2 is written into the entry pointed by the tail, and both tail and nextTail are incremented by 1 as well.
3. On the rising edge of the clock, if Load_Write_valid=1, indicating that the LSQ_WriteBack module requests to update the Load Queue data, the corresponding entry's addressReady and address fields are updated based on the input WB_LSQTag, WB_addressReady, and WB_address, with other data remaining unchanged.
4. On the rising edge of the clock, if TryIssue_valid=1, indicating that the TryIssueStore module requests to update the Load Queue data, the corresponding entry's state field is updated based on the input TryIssue_ldqPtr and TryIssue_state.
5. On the rising edge of the clock, entries are marked as invalid by setting the Killed flag to 1 based on RR_valid1 and RR_valid2 inputs and the LSQtag values. If RR_valid1=1, the Killed flag for the entry pointed by LSQtag1 is set to 1. Similarly, if RR_valid2=1, the Killed flag for the entry pointed by LSQtag2 is set to 1.
6. On the rising edge of the clock, instructions are committed if Commit_vaild1 or Commit_vaild2 are asserted. If Commit_vaild1=1, the commited flag of the entry pointed by Commit_LSQTag1 is set to 1. Similarly, if Commit_vaild2=1, the commited flag of the entry pointed by Commit_LSQTag2 is set to 1.
7. On the rising edge of the clock, if the queue is not empty, it will determine whether to pop an entry from the queue based on the commited, Killed, and state fields of the current entry pointed by the header. If commited=1, the instruction can be committed, and the header is incremented by 1 while decreasing usage by 1. If commited=0, it checks if Killed=1 and state≠1; if both conditions are met, the entry is considered invalid, and the header is incremented by 1 while decreasing usage by 1.
8. On the rising edge of the clock, if D_state_valid=1, the state of the entry pointed by D_LSQTag is updated to 2. If D_excp_valid=1, then excp_valid, excp_cause, and excp_tval for the entry pointed by D_LSQTag are updated with the values D_excp_valid, D_excp_cause, and D_excp_tval respectively.
9. The outputs include AvailEntryCount=load_queue_size - usage, the current tail pointer tail, the next tail pointer nextTail, the Empty flag (which is 1 when usage=0), and the header pointer header. Also, the data stored in the entry pointed by the header, including FrontQueue_addressReady, FrontQueue_Killed, FrontQueue_state, and FrontQueue_address, are output.
10. Based on the input require_tag, the corresponding entry is located, and internal data including Killed, address, Sub_OP, RobTag, excp_valid, excp_cause, excp_tval, Function_type, IsaRd, and PhyRd are output.

    <Function description="This module serves as a storage for load instruction requests sent to memory, operating as a circular queue with a depth of load_queue_size and a width of 197 bits. As a circular queue, it ensures that the header, tail, or nextTail pointers wrap around to the other end of the queue when they reach the boundary, thus enabling the cyclical behavior. Furthermore, the queue is capable of updating the data within each entry on every rising edge of the clock cycle based on input signals and can output relevant data at any time through combinational logic queries. 
    The data format within an entry is as follows: Bits 196:165 excp_tval, 164:159 excp_cause, 158 excp_valid, 157:126 imm, 125:122 Sub_OP, 121:119 Function_type, 118 ControlFlowInsn, 117:113 IsaRd, 112 Operand2Ready, 111:107 IsaRs2, 106 Operand1Ready, 105:101 IsaRs1, 100:69 pc, 68:65 LSQTag, 64:61 RobTag, 60:55 PhyRs1, 54:49 PhyRs2, 48:43 PhyRd, 42:37 LPhyRd, 36:35 state, 34 commited, 33 Killed, 32 addressReady, 31:0 address.
    The operations are as follows: 
    1. When reset=0, all data stored within the entries of the queue are initialized to 0. The header, tail, usage count, and Empty flags are also set to 0, while nextTail is set to 1, indicating the next tail pointer position.
    2. On the rising edge of the clock, data is written into the queue in order if LA_EN1 and LA_EN2 are asserted. If LA_EN1=1, Entry_data1 is written into the entry pointed by the tail, and both tail and nextTail are incremented by 1. If LA_EN2=1, Entry_data2 is written into the entry pointed by the tail, and both tail and nextTail are incremented by 1 as well.
    3. On the rising edge of the clock, if Load_Write_valid=1, indicating that the LSQ_WriteBack module requests to update the Load Queue data, the corresponding entry's addressReady and address fields are updated based on the input WB_LSQTag, WB_addressReady, and WB_address, with other data remaining unchanged.
    4. On the rising edge of the clock, if TryIssue_valid=1, indicating that the TryIssueStore module requests to update the Load Queue data, the corresponding entry's state field is updated based on the input TryIssue_ldqPtr and TryIssue_state.
    5. On the rising edge of the clock, entries are marked as invalid by setting the Killed flag to 1 based on RR_valid1 and RR_valid2 inputs and the LSQtag values. If RR_valid1=1, the Killed flag for the entry pointed by LSQtag1 is set to 1. Similarly, if RR_valid2=1, the Killed flag for the entry pointed by LSQtag2 is set to 1.
    6. On the rising edge of the clock, instructions are committed if Commit_vaild1 or Commit_vaild2 are asserted. If Commit_vaild1=1, the commited flag of the entry pointed by Commit_LSQTag1 is set to 1. Similarly, if Commit_vaild2=1, the commited flag of the entry pointed by Commit_LSQTag2 is set to 1.
    7. On the rising edge of the clock, if the queue is not empty, it will determine whether to pop an entry from the queue based on the commited, Killed, and state fields of the current entry pointed by the header. If commited=1, the instruction can be committed, and the header is incremented by 1 while decreasing usage by 1. If commited=0, it checks if Killed=1 and state≠1; if both conditions are met, the entry is considered invalid, and the header is incremented by 1 while decreasing usage by 1.
    8. On the rising edge of the clock, if D_state_valid=1, the state of the entry pointed by D_LSQTag is updated to 2. If D_excp_valid=1, then excp_valid, excp_cause, and excp_tval for the entry pointed by D_LSQTag are updated with the values D_excp_valid, D_excp_cause, and D_excp_tval respectively.
    9. The outputs include AvailEntryCount=load_queue_size - usage, the current tail pointer tail, the next tail pointer nextTail, the Empty flag (which is 1 when usage=0), and the header pointer header. Also, the data stored in the entry pointed by the header, including FrontQueue_addressReady, FrontQueue_Killed, FrontQueue_state, and FrontQueue_address, are output.
    10. Based on the input require_tag, the corresponding entry is located, and internal data including Killed, address, Sub_OP, RobTag, excp_valid, excp_cause, excp_tval, Function_type, IsaRd, and PhyRd are output."/>

**assistant**:
To generate the given module in Chisel, we will follow these steps:

1. Define the class for the `LoadQueue` module with parameters and IO ports as specified.
2. Incorporate the logic for initializing the queue entries upon reset.
3. Implement the logic for writing data into the queue when enabled and on the rising edge of the clock.
4. Update the specific entry fields as per the conditions stated when respective valid signals are high.
5. Implement the logic for marking entries invalid, committing instructions, and popping entries from the queue based on the given conditions.
6. Update the state and exception fields of the entry when requested and valid signals are asserted.
7. Calculate and output the `AvailEntryCount`, `Empty` flag, `header`, and other output signals based on the current state of the queue.
8. Ensure that all signals are properly defined and initialized.
9. Verify that the functionality aligns with the described operations and the queue behaves as a circular buffer.

Now let's generate the Chisel code.

```scala
import chisel3._
import chisel3.util._

class LoadQueue extends Module {

    // Define all the inputs

    val d_excp_tval = Input(UInt(32.W))

    // Define all the outputs

    val empty = Output(Bool())
    val header = Output(UInt(4.W))
    val frontQueue_addressReady = Output(Bool())
    val frontQueue_killed = Output(Bool())

    val require_phyRd = Output(UInt(6.W))
  })

  // Define the queue
  val queue = SyncReadMem(load_queue_size, UInt(197.W))

  // Define registers to keep track of the queue state
  val head = RegInit(0.U(4.W))
  val tail = RegInit(0.U(4.W))
  val nextTail = RegInit(1.U(4.W))
  val usageCount = RegInit(0.U(4.W))

  // Logic for initializing the queue on reset
  when(io.reset) {
    head := 0.U
    tail := 0.U
    nextTail := 1.U
    usageCount := 0.U
    // Loop to reset all queue entries should be implemented here
    // Chisel does not support iterating over memory, so we assume a reset controller does this in practice
  }

  // Logic for writing data into the queue
  when(io.la_en1) {
    queue(tail) := io.entry_data1
    tail := tail + 1.U
    nextTail := nextTail + 1.U
    usageCount := usageCount + 1.U
  }
  when(io.la_en2) {
    queue(tail) := io.entry_data2
    tail := tail + 1.U
    nextTail := nextTail + 1.U
    usageCount := usageCount + 1.U
  }

  // Logic for updating specific entry fields
  when(io.load_write_valid) {
    val entry = queue(io.wb_lsqTag)
    // Extract parts of entry and update addressReady and address here
    // Assume a helper function 'updateEntry' is available
    // queue(io.wb_lsqTag) := updateEntry(entry, io.wb_addressReady, io.wb_address)
  }

  // Additional logic to handle other update conditions, marking entries invalid, committing instructions, and popping entries
  // ...

  // Calculate and output AvailEntryCount and Empty
  io.availEntryCount := load_queue_size.U - usageCount
  io.empty := usageCount === 0.U

  // Output the data for the current header entry
  // ...

  // Output the data for the entry being inquired
  // ...

  // Rest of the logic follows the functional description provided
  // ...
}

// Instantiate the LoadQueue module
println((new chisel3.stage.ChiselStage).emitVerilog(new LoadQueue))
```

Please note that the actual code for updating entries, outputting data, and other functionalities inside the queue needs to be implemented. The code provided serves as a scaffold and assumes certain helper functions and mechanisms (like the `updateEntry` function) that would be used for more detailed operations within the queue. Since Chisel does not support iterating over or directly resetting `SyncReadMem`, an external reset controller is assumed to handle the memory reset.

--------------------

**assistant**:
Certainly, let's build the `LoadQueue` module step by step, focusing on each part of the functionality.

### Loop to Reset All Queue Entries
In Chisel, memories initialized with `SyncReadMem` do not support bulk memory initialization or reset, so the reset of each entry must be handled individually, typically by external logic. However, for the sake of the example, let's assume we can loop through the memory entries in Chisel and set them to zero during reset.

```scala
// Assuming a hypothetical function to reset all memory entries
// This is not synthesizable in Chisel, and an external reset mechanism should be used instead
for (i <- 0 until load_queue_size) {
  queue(i) := 0.U
}
```

### Logic for Updating Specific Entry Fields
For updating specific fields within a memory entry, we need to decompose the entry, modify the relevant fields, and then recompose the entry.

```scala
when(io.load_write_valid) {
  val entry = queue.read(io.wb_lsqTag)
  val updatedEntry = entry.asTypeOf(new Bundle {
    val address = UInt(32.W)
    val restOfData = UInt((197 - 32).W)
  })
  updatedEntry.address := Mux(io.wb_addressReady, io.wb_address, updatedEntry.address)

  queue.write(io.wb_lsqTag, updatedEntry.asUInt)
}
```

### Logic for Marking Entries Invalid, Committing Instructions, and Popping Entries
This part of the logic requires tracking the state of each entry and updating it according to various signals.

```scala
// Define a register array to keep track of entry states
val entryStates = Reg(Vec(load_queue_size, new Bundle {
  val committed = Bool()
  val killed = Bool()
  val state = UInt(2.W)
  val addressReady = Bool()
  val address = UInt(32.W)
}))

// Logic for marking entries as invalid
when(io.rr_valid1) {
  entryStates(io.lsqTag1).killed := true.B
}
when(io.rr_valid2) {
  entryStates(io.lsqTag2).killed := true.B
}

// Logic for committing instructions
when(io.commit_valid1) {
  entryStates(io.commit_lsqTag1).committed := true.B
}
when(io.commit_valid2) {
  entryStates(io.commit_lsqTag2).committed := true.B
}

// Logic for popping entries from the queue
when(!io.empty && entryStates(head).committed && !entryStates(head).killed) {
  // Increment the head pointer and decrement the usage count
  head := head + 1.U
  usageCount := usageCount - 1.U
}
```

### Output the Data for the Current Header Entry
To output the data for the current front entry in the Load Queue, we need to read from the queue and output the relevant signals.

```scala
val frontEntry = queue.read(head)
val frontEntryBundle = frontEntry.asTypeOf(new Bundle {
  val address = UInt(32.W)
  // Define all other fields according to the entry structure
})

io.frontQueue_addressReady := entryStates(head).addressReady
io.frontQueue_killed := entryStates(head).killed
io.frontQueue_state := entryStates(head).state
io.frontQueue_address := frontEntryBundle.address
```

### Output the Data for the Entry Being Inquired
This requires reading from the queue based on an input tag and outputting the relevant fields.

```scala
val inquiredEntry = queue.read(io.inquire_tag)
val inquiredEntryBundle = inquiredEntry.asTypeOf(new Bundle {
  val address = UInt(32.W)
  // Define all other fields according to the entry structure
})

io.require_address := inquiredEntryBundle.address
// Output the rest of the required fields in a similar manner
```

### Rest of the Logic Following the Functional Description
The rest of the logic would include handling the various conditions such as state updates, exception updates, and calculating the available entry count and whether the queue is empty. This would typically involve additional control logic and state tracking similar to the examples provided above.

This series of code snippets provides a general idea of how the various parts of the `LoadQueue` could be implemented in Chisel. However, keep in mind that in practice, Chisel does not allow the kind of memory initialization or per-entry reset we've shown here. In a real-world scenario, you would likely use an external reset controller to initialize the queue and possibly a more complex state machine to manage the various conditions and operations that need to be performed on the queue.
